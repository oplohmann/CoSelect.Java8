A solution using Java8+ for CSP-style select as in Google's Go making use of HawtDispatch for non-blocking IO. Run the test case CoSelectTest to see how it works.

Requires JDK8 (at least lambda-8-b92 downloadable from http://jdk8.java.net/lambda/).
Currently NetBeans and Intellij IDEA support JDK8. I've been using IntelliJ IDEA and had no problems with it.
